# End to End ML Pipeline for TikTok Content Moderation: Claim Detection System using Random Forest & XGBoost

 New Project Launch

I'm excited to share my latest machine learning project that addresses real-world content moderation challenges! This end-to-end system classifies TikTok videos as either "claims" (requiring fact-checking) or "opinions" to help prioritize moderation efforts.



 What I Built
 Complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment
 Binary classification system with optimized recall to minimize misinformation risk
 Comparative analysis: Random Forest vs XGBoost performance
 Feature importance analysis and comprehensive model evaluation



 Technical Stack
Python | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Jupyter Notebook



 Dataset
 19,382 TikTok videos with metadata
 12 features including engagement metrics, transcription text, and user status
 Binary classification target: `claim_status` (claim = 1, opinion = 0)



 Key Achievements
 Successfully processed 19K+ TikTok videos
 Implemented recall-focused evaluation for ethical AI
 Delivered actionable insights for content moderation prioritization
 Demonstrated ability to build production-ready ML systems that solve real business problems



 Installation & Usage
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/khraffay/tiktok-content-moderation-ml-pipeline.git
cd tiktok-content-moderation-ml-pipeline
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
